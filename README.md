# Co-Simulation
Imperial College London Dissertation Used Cases

In this project, a co-simulation communication interface based on Matlab/Simulink is designed. The interface uses the TCP/IP protocol to transmit signals over LAN and WAN. Independent simulation models can then be connected through the interface to facilitate co-simulation by multiple parties without disclosing proprietary models. The interface was tested using a grid-connected inverter model and a 116-bus transmission line model, and simulation results were recorded for both LAN and cross-grid communication. To improve the simulation efficiency, the project also explores the combination of parallel simulation and co-simulation.
